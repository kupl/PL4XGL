# PL4XGL

This is the implementation of our submitted paper "PL4XGL: A Programming Language Approach to Explainable Graph Learning." This implementation aims to reproduce the results of $PL4XGL$ in Table  3, Figure 11 of our paper, and Figure 2 of our supplementary material.


``GraphClassification`` and ``NodeClassification`` folders include the implementation of $PL4XGL$ for graph classification and node classification tasks, respectively. For example, if you want to reproduce the results of $PL4XGL$ for the graph classification datasets $MUTAG$, $BBBP$, and $BACE$, move to ``GraphClassification`` folder and follow the instructions. If you want to reproduce the results for the node classification datasets, move to ``NodeClassification`` folder.

## Requirement

* python >= 3.8.8

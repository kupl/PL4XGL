# PL4XGL

This is the implementation of our submitted paper "_PL4XGL_: A Programming Language Approach to Explainable Graph Learning." This implementation aims to reproduce the results of _PL4XGL_ in Table  3, Figure 11 of our paper, and Figure 2 of our supplementary material.


## Requirement

* python >= 3.8.8



## How to use

``GraphClassification`` and ``NodeClassification`` folders include the implementation of $PL4XGL$ for graph classification and node classification tasks, respectively. 

### Reproducing results for Graph Classification Datasets

if you want to reproduce the results of $PL4XGL$ for the graph classification datasets ($MUTAG$, $BBBP$, and $BACE$ datasets), move to ``GraphClassification`` folder and follow the instructions. 

### Reproducing results for Node Classification Datasets

if you want to reproduce the results of $PL4XGL$ for the node classification datasets ($Texas$, $Cornell$, $Wisconsin$, $BA$-$Shapes$, and $Tree$-$Cycles$ datasets) move to ``GraphClassification`` folder and follow the instructions.
